FloppyBird is a new crossbreed Flying Bird game. Mechanics of the game differs from FlappyBird. You have to escape from rocks, they'll appear randomly.
By tap, you will make your bird flying and escaping from the rocks. You'll earn points by passing them. If you hit to rocks, fly to high or fall down; game over!
Be careful, speed of the bird increases by your points increase(Don't worry, you'll earn more points if your bird flies faster :D)
Enjoy it!
